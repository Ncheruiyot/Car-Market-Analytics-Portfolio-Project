# üöó Car Market Analytics SQL Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Car Market Analytics SQL Project!  
This repository demonstrates advanced SQL data analysis skills using a rich automotive dataset. The project focuses on data cleaning, exploration, and insights about car brands, models, performance, pricing, fuel types, and technology trends for the year 2025.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This portfolio project uses MySQL Workbench to analyze a comprehensive car dataset, demonstrating SQL capabilities in:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis
- Aggregation, filtering, grouping, and string manipulation
- Reporting actionable insights

---

## üìä Dataset Description

- **Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdulmalik1518/cars-datasets-2025
- **Fields:** Brand, Model, Engine, CC/Battery Capacity, Horsepower, Total Speed, Acceleration, Price, Fuel Type, Seats, Torque
- **Scope:** Includes major manufacturers and models for 2025, covering performance, economy, electric, and hybrid cars.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Setup

1. **Create Database and Table**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE CARS;
   USE CARS;
   ```

2. **Import Dataset**

   - Use MySQL Workbench's "Table Data Import Wizard" to load [Cars Datasets 2025.csv](Cars%20Datasets%202025.csv) into a table named `cars_2025`.

3. **Verify Table Structure**

   ```sql
   DESCRIBE cars_2025;
   SELECT * FROM cars_2025 LIMIT 5;
   ```

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning

- Check for missing or blank values in critical columns
- Remove rows with missing essential information
- Standardize and clean price, horsepower, and torque fields for numeric analysis

```sql

-- DATA CLEANING --
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_ROWS,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `COMPANY NAMES` IS NULL OR `COMPANY NAMES` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_COMPANY,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `CARS NAMES` IS NULL OR `CARS NAMES` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_CAR_NAME,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `ENGINES` IS NULL OR `ENGINES` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_ENGINES,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `CC/BATTERY CAPACITY` IS NULL OR `CC/BATTERY CAPACITY` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_CCBATTERY_CAPACITY,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `HORSEPOWER` IS NULL OR `HORSEPOWER` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_HORSEPOWER,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `TOTAL SPEED` IS NULL OR `TOTAL SPEED` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_TOTAL_SPEEDR,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `PERFORMANCE(0 - 100 )KM/H` IS NULL OR `PERFORMANCE(0 - 100 )KM/H` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_PERFORMANCE,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `CARS PRICES` IS NULL OR `CARS PRICES` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_CAR_PRICES,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `FUEL TYPES` IS NULL OR `FUEL TYPES` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_FUEL_TYPES,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `SEATS` IS NULL OR `SEATS` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_SEATS,
  SUM(CASE WHEN `TORQUE` IS NULL OR `TORQUE` = '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NULL_TORQUE
FROM CARS_2025;

SELECT * FROM CARS_2025
WHERE `CC/BATTERY CAPACITY` IS NULL 
OR TRIM(`CC/BATTERY CAPACITY`) = '' ;

DELETE FROM CARS_2025
WHERE `CC/BATTERY CAPACITY` IS NULL 
OR `CC/BATTERY CAPACITY` = '' ;

SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
```
